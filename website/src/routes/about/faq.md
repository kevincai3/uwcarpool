###What is this website?

UW Carpool is a simple search engine to help you find carpools in the various Facebook ride sharing groups in the Waterloo area. We parse and classify all the posts in the Facebook groups so you can search directly for the carpools that you want!

### How do I search for a Carpool?

You can simply type what you're looking for into the search bar. We support locations, dates (up to 1 week in advance), common acronyms ("bk to dt tom") and type ("driving"/"looking")! In addition, you can use the different dropdowns on the results page to filter even further.

### I'm not getting what I searched!

Based on what you searched and our data, we try to return results that match as closely as possible. Sometimes we can't match exactly, and end up returning extra results. Check that the filters on the result page match what you're looking for. If not, let us know through the feedback form and we'll figure out why!

### I canâ€™t find my city!

Currently our database only contains cities in Canada that have high populations or are popular destinations for students in Waterloo. If you have a city you would like us to add, email us at uwaterloocarpool@gmail.com or use the feedback form below and we will be happy to oblige.

### I found an incorrect result!

If you find a post that is incorrectly classified let us know with the "report post" button. We're still improving our classification algorithm, and your feedback will help a ton! You can also email us at uwaterloocarpool@gmail.com or use the form below if it's a more complicated bug.
