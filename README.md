# UWCarpool

## What is it?

UW Carpool is a simple search engine to help people find carpools in the various Facebook ride sharing groups in the Waterloo, Ontario, Canada area.  Historically, it's very tedious to find carpools in Facebook groups since it involves manually scrolling through all the posts in the group. UW Carpool parses and classifies the posts ahead of time to allow better searching. [See it live here](https://uwcarpool.com).



## Where do I look?

[Check here](./classify/readme.ipynb) to see how our backend classification algorithm works! You can also view our server and frontend code under the website folder.



## What if I want to contribute/fork?

The repository doesn't contain everything that's required to run the application, mainly access to Facebook posts and db configurations. Send us an email at uwaterloocarpool@gmail.com and we can provide more information.
